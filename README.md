# 🔗 Blockchain Web App

## 📌 Description
This is a **Java Spring Boot-based blockchain web application** with Firebase integration. It allows users to:

- **Register and log in securely** (Firebase Authentication)
- **Send and receive money** between user accounts
- **Mine coins** to validate transactions and earn rewards
- **View personal transaction history**
- **View analytics and balances**
- **View the entire blockchain ledger**, including all blocks and transactions
- Manage **public and private keys** for secure transactions

This app demonstrates **real blockchain functionalities** including block creation, transaction validation, proof of work mining, and cryptographic key management, integrated into a **full-stack web application**.


## ✨ Key Features

✔️ **User authentication** using Firebase  
✔️ **Public and private keys** for each user  
✔️ **Send and receive transactions** with validation  
✔️ **Mine coins** to validate transactions and add blocks  
✔️ **View personal transaction history**  
✔️ **View analytics and user balances**  
✔️ **Full blockchain explorer** – view all blocks and transactions  
✔️ **Responsive frontend UI** built with Spring Boot static pages
